bring out other details more clearly.

Making an abstraction doesn't mean it's useful

## KISS
- Keep It Simple Stupid
- Most system work best if they are kept simple rather than make complicated

## Prevent making unnecessary abstractions
- Only create an abstraction when it makes sense
1) Code reusability becomes problematic
2) State management becomes difficult
3) Performance suffers

- Don't fixate on the DRY-princile( Don't repeat yourself - DRY )
1) Don't repeat yourself (DRY) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.
